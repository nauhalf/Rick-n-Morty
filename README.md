## Design Inspiration
For the UI Design, the list page I was inspired by [Jakes Trevor's Rick and Morty App](https://www.behance.net/gallery/146439915/Rick-and-Morty-App?tracking_source=search_projects%7CMorty) and the detail character from [Rick and Morty Wiki Fandom Character Page](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Rick_Sanchez)

![Typical App Architecture](https://developer.android.com/static/topic/libraries/architecture/images/mad-arch-overview.png)


The architecture of **Rick'n Morty** is composed by two layers, the *UI Layer* and *Data Layer*. But it also can be added with additional layer called *Domain Layer* to simplify and reuse the interactions between the UI and Data Layers.
